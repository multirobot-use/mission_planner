# Human-Aware Collaboration Planner

## Overview

This repository contains a ROS framework that functions as a cognitive task planner and mission supervisor in charge of planning missions and governing the behavior of multi-UAV teams.

The system is designed to ensure the safety of both airborne equipment and human workers at all times.

This system implements a software layer part of a multi-layer software architecture that is further divided into two, a High-Level Planner, centralized on the ground station, and an Agent Behavior Manager, distributed on board each UAV. In this way, the High-Level Planner receives task requests as inputs, and its work is to coordinate all the UAVs, assigning to each of them a mission plan to follow. The Agent Behavior Manager is the one in charge of executing and supervising those plans, calling the appropriate lower-level controllers at any given time.

The controllers for each specific action inside each of the tasks are not included in this work, but simple
versions of those controllers can be found in this repository in order to be able to test the software layer properly in simulation.

The multi-robot task allocation during the mission planning process is performed by an heuristic algorithm implemented in Matlab that can be found in a [separate repository](https://github.com/multirobot-use/task_planner). This Matlab code is connected with ROS through the [matlab_ros_connector](scripts/matlab_ros_connector.m) script available in the scripts folder. It implements a ROS Action Server that receives planning and replanning requests from the High-Level Planner.

This software is currently being developed on Ubuntu 20.04 with ROS Noetic.

A more detailed description of the ROS framework can be found in [[1]](#1).

2. Create a ROS workspace

```bash
mkdir -p ~/mission_planner_ws/src
cd ~/mission_planner_ws/
catkin build -DPYTHON_EXECUTABLE=/usr/bin/python
source devel/setup.bash
echo "source $HOME/mission_planner_ws/devel/setup.bash" >> ~/.bashrc
```

3. Clone necessary repositories

```bash
cd ~/mission_planner_ws/src/
git clone https://github.com/multirobot-use/mission_planner.git
git clone https://github.com/multirobot-use/task_planner.git
git clone https://github.com/grvcTeam/grvc-ual.git
git clone https://github.com/grvcTeam/grvc-utils.git
```

5. Ignore some packages

```bash
touch ~/mission_planner_ws/src/grvc-utils/mission_lib/CATKIN_IGNORE
```

6. Install Groot and its dependencies

```bash
cd ~/mission_planner_ws/src/
sudo apt install -y qtbase5-dev libqt5svg5-dev libzmq3-dev libdw-dev
git clone https://github.com/BehaviorTree/Groot.git
touch ~/mission_planner_ws/src/Groot/CATKIN_IGNORE
cd ..
rosdep install --from-paths src --ignore-src
catkin build
```

7. Install and configure UAL. Only MAVROS needed. Make sure to install its dependencies when asked

```bash
cd ~/mission_planner_ws/src/grvc-ual
./configure.py
```

8. Install MAVROS packages

```bash
sudo apt install -y ros-noetic-mavros ros-noetic-mavros-extras
sudo geographiclib-get-geoids egm96-5
sudo usermod -a -G dialout $USER
sudo apt remove modemmanager
```

9.1 (Optional) Install RealSense plugins for real-life execution

```bash
sudo apt install -y ros-noetic-realsense2-camera ros-noetic-realsense2-description
```

9.2 (Optional) Download 99-realsense-libusb.rules file from [github](https://github.com/IntelRealSense/librealsense/blob/master/config/99-realsense-libusb.rules)

9.3 (Optional) Give permissions to read the data from the RealSense camera

```bash
sudo cp 99-realsense-libusb.rules /etc/udev/rules.d/99-realsense-libusb.rules
```

10. Install PX4 for SITL simulations

```bash
sudo apt install -y libgstreamer1.0-dev python-jinja2 python-pip
pip install numpy toml
cd ~/mission_planner_ws/src/
git clone https://github.com/PX4/Firmware.git
cd Firmware
git checkout v1.10.2
git submodule update --init --recursive
make
make px4_sitl_default gazebo
```

11. Build

```bash
cd ~/mission_planner_ws/
catkin build
```

**Note**: In case that the installation did not go well, try compile each package individually.

12. Matlab setup

To use ROS in Matlab we need the [ROS Toolbox](https://www.mathworks.com/products/ros.html). Once the toolbox is installed, to set up the Matlab-ROS connection, we need to open Matlab as admin (in order to be able to save Matlab's path) and then run the [gen_matlab_msgs](scripts/gen_matlab_msgs.m) script.

```bash
roscd mission_planner
cd scripts
sudo matlab -nodisplay -nosplash -r "gen_matlab_msgs; exit"
```

We will also need to include [task_planner](https://github.com/multirobot-use/task_planner) installation folder and subfolders in the MATLAB's path.

If you experience problems related with the python executable while executing the above script, you may find useful to create a virtual python environment, e.g., in my case, ROS need python3.8 to be the default python executable, but MATLAB 2023b needs python3.9. Creating a virtual python environment and specifying it's executable route in the ROS Toolbox Preferences solved the problem for me:

```bash
cd ~
python3.9 -m venv matlab_env
```

```matlab
pyenv('Version', '~/matlab_env/bin/python3.9')
```

## Test

To test if the system is working correctly you can launch a simulation and order tasks or unexpected events by executing Makefile recipes.

**Note**: Simulation.launch file has some parameters to facilitate the configuration of the simulations, having parameters to select the number of UAVs, the Gazebo world, debug modes and some other things. See the heading of the file to know the different world options.

```bash
make launch
...
make monitor task_id=1 human_target=human_target_1 number=2 distance=1.5
make inspect task_id=2
make deliver task_id=3 human_target=human_target_1 tool=hammer
...
make battery_off agent_id=1
make battery_ok  agent_id=1
...
make mission_over
...
rosnode kill /uav_1/agent_behaviour_manager
rosrun mission_planner agent_behaviour_manager __ns:uav_1
...
rosnode kill /high_level_planner
```

**Note**: For information on how to launch tasks manually you can run `make gesture_info` or just read the recipes in the Makefile.

We can also use the tmuxinator tool to launch the simulation nodes in a more organized way using the [launch script](scripts/launch_matlab_ros_connection.sh) availbale in the scripts folder. This script creates a tmux session according to the specifications present in the [config file](scripts/matlab_ros_connection.yml). To use this method we'll need to install tmuxinator and add some shell additions to our terminal:

```bash
sudo apt install tmuxinator
chmod +x scripts/launch_matlab_ros_connection.sh
chmod +x scripts/shell_additions.sh
./scripts/shell_additions.sh
```

Now we can launch the simulation using tmuxinator:

```bash
./scripts/launch_matlab_ros_connection.sh
```

## Monitoring the Behaviour Tree execution with Groot

There is a Make recipe for launching a Groot node to monitor the execution of the BT in real time or replay a log file.


```bash
make groot
```

To monitor a BT we just has to specify:

* Server IP: localhost
* Publisher Port: 1666 + (ID - 1) * 2
* Server Port: 1667 + (ID - 1) * 2

E.g. for the UAV_1:

* Server IP: localhost
* Publisher Port: 1666
* Server Port: 1667

**Note**: fbl log files are stored in `~/.ros` and are named as `bt_trace_uav_` + ID + `.fbl`
